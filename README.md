# Label Representation in Modeling Classification as Seq2Seq

- Forked from google-research/text-to-text-transfer-transformer.
- Uses HfPyTorchModel to fine-tune on same tasks with different labels.

## Our Paper: 
We are still working further on our project, and will update our paper in the future.
